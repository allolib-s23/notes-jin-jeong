# Notes from Jin Jeong


## Demo 1
- An arrangement of the A-type Tetris theme by Hirokazu Tanaka (also originally known as Korobeiniki)
- [Link to repo](https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-jin-jeong)
- ```./run.sh tutorials/synthesis/tetris.cpp```, then press 'Q'
- As my first piece, I mainly wanted to play around with allolib. I thought the sounds that it could produce would work well for a retro/8-bit vibe, so I thought I'd try my hand at recreating the tetris theme. It uses four different voices to emulate 8-bit music, which typically uses three voices and a percussive element. The file was based on the SimpleSineEnv.cpp file, and uses modified square and triangle waves for the voices.

## Demo 2
- Untitled Original
- [Link to repo](https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-jin-jeong)
- ```./run.sh tutorials/synthesis/bass.cpp```, then press 'A'
- I was largely inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU7nARUa2CA), and I wanted to see if I could emulate that sort of bouncy retro bass sound. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to accomplish that, as I wasn't able to figure out how to give the bass more shape, although it did have some percussive hits on note changes that I liked. The bass solo itself is just an original composition that I came up with to test out the sound. This is when I began using Noteflight in order to create music scores to reference rather than typing out code with the melody in my brain.

## Demos 3-4
- Untitled Original
- [Link to repo](https://github.com/allolib-s23/demo1-jin-jeong)
- ```./run.sh tutorials/synthesis/idk.cpp```
- Another foray into video game music. This time, I was largely inspired by the game "Mother 3" for the GBA, namely [this particular song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMAFmBC-z-E). If you listen to the video you'll definitely be able to hear some of the ideas I took inspiration from. For the song itself, I was mainly just freestyling. Creating a song with different parts that are supposed to mesh together is a lot more difficult than I expected, and I didn't expect it to be easy in the first place. The song sent through multiple iterations as I built upon what I had previously completed and tweaked some parts as I went along.
- As for the arrangement, I wasn't going for anything particularly specific other than a similar vibe to the song I linked above, and the fact that I wanted it to be a little somber in tone, but not sad. The second part is a little more grandiose and triumphant, but not entirely happy either. For the last iteration, I created another transition to brign it all back to the original motif, with some modified elements so that it wasn't all the same.
- The process was a lot of fun, but using voices in Allolib proves to be a little difficult when trying to get the sound I want. Having four different voices all playing notes at the same time can easily cause the overall sound to be extremely muddy and disorienting, so I was forced to bring the volume of two accompanying voices down in order for it to sound decent. Which is a shame because I really liked how the piece sounds when all voices are clear and can be heard. You can hear and see the original score [here](https://www.noteflight.com/scores/view/566b90ed0f5d46690ed1b648660110295c106215).
- The instruments were tweaked to further fit the vibe that I wanted, but I do wish they were a little less fuzzy.
